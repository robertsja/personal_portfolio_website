                    <p>For this project, I worked in a team to implement servlet features specified by an Assignment brief.</p>
                    <p><br><strong>The project was composed of 3 stages:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Project Planning and Task Breakdowns</li>
                            <li>Project Development</li>
                            <li>Project Testing</li>
                        </ul><br>
                    <p>This project was a University Project. As a team we decided to work in an Agile Environment, developing components of the 
                        web page in sprints. We used Git with GitHub for version control. The RESTful web service was developed with Java, using JAX-RS
                        specification, and the Hibernate library to interact with a MySQL database. 
                        <br><br>
                        It was fun to change my mindset from a web page to a RESTful web service. Coding in Java was fun, I hadn't worked with Java since Year 13.
                        Learning JAX-RS and Hibernate was a new experience, but I was able to get the hang of it after a few tutorials and YouTube videos.
                        <br><br>
                        The project was a success, and we were able to get an A+ overall for the course and get full marks. 
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Final Thoughts</strong><br>
                        This was a stressful project with a lot of late nights. I'm glad to have gotten through it with my team and get full marks. 
                        <br><br>
                        Some setbacks we had were time management. We had this the project due with many other assignments/projects, and combined with extra curriculars,
                        it was hard to see organise times for all of the team to work at the same time. We got through it in the end. 
                        <br><br>
                        Another fun project with good marks at the end of it. Love my team (shoutout Darryl and Will)
