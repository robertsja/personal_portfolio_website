                    <p>For this project, I in a team to create a Games Library Web Application for a University project</p>
                    <p><br><strong>The project was composed of 3 stages:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Project Planning and Task Breakdowns</li>
                            <li>Project Development</li>
                            <li>Project Testing</li>
                        </ul><br>
                    <p>This project was a University Project. As a team we decided to work in an Agile Environment, developing components of the 
                        web page in sprints. We used Git with GitHub for version control. The web page was developed on the PyCharm IDE 
                        and used Python, Flask, Jinja Templates and a SQL database to store the game data. 
                        <br><br>
                        Learning Flask and Jinja templates was a fun and new experience, it was cool to see how I could integrate my 
                        knowledge in Python with Web Development. This was also the first project we used where we had to work with a Database in the backend.
                        I was glad that I had prior SQL knowledge because it would have been a struggle without it.
                        <br><br>
                        The project was a success, and we were able to get an A+ overall for the course.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Final Thoughts</strong><br>
                        This was the first big project that University gave us and I'm glad that my team was able to stay ontop of the workload.
                        I learnt a lot about working in a team and how to manage a project. I also learnt a lot about Flask and Jinja templates, and how to use them
                        <br><br>
                        Some setbacks we came across was setting up the Virtual Environment and Environmental variables. This was the first time we 
                        were working with a virtual environment or environmental variables so it was an effort to get my head around them. 
                        We gladly asked the tutors to explain it a bit more for us and we were able to get it working. 
                        <br><br>
                        This was a great project with a great team that I was able to work with throughout University. (shoutout Darryl and Will)
