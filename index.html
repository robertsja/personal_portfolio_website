                <p>Human future is software and data. As a 3rd year student in Computer Science, 
                    Jarrod is best equipping himself to have a skillset that will be able to thrive in this future. 
                    He is passionate about learning new skills and creating solutions to problems.<br><br>
                    Meeting new people and having a good chat is an easy task for Jarrod. 
                    He backs this up with experience as a Data Consultant intern and a Brand Ambassador, 
                    both roles (especially the brand ambassador role) requiring the ability to create relationships with 
                    clients and new people. This skill allows him to slot into any group and be a 
                    good team player both in the workplace and in free time.<br><br>
                    Jarrod strives for perfection (even though in his mind it is never achievable) 
                    and wants to excel in whatever future he finds himself in. 
                    He is always discovering new skills and interests, whether that be football, 
                    movies, or personal projects and loves a good movie. 
                    He is open to any opportunity that may be available, 
                    so if youâ€™re interested in his skillset then flick him a message, 
                    or give him a movie recommendation in a PM.</p>
