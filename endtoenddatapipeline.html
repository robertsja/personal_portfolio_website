                    <h2 class="subtitle"><span>Project</span> Description</h2>
                    <p>For this project, I created an end-to-end data pipeline that gathered job data from a job board, cleaned it, and reported on it using PowerBI. The pipeline was created using Python, Fabric, and PowerBI</p>
                    <p><br><strong>The project was composed of 4 stages:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Project Requirements and Scope Definition</li>
                            <li>Data Gathering using Python WebScraper</li>
                            <li>Data Transformation using Microsoft Fabric and PySpark/SparkSQL</li>
                            <li>Reporting using PowerBI</li>
                        </ul><br>
                    <p>This project was done in an agile environment, and therefore we went through the Kick-off process and documented 
                        the project requirements and scope. We the started the development of the Python Webscraper. We used 
                        Selenium, Chromium and BeautifulSoup to gather the data. The data was exported to a CSV because we couldn't find out how
                        to host the webscraper on Fabric as this was when Fabric just got released.
                        <br><br>
                        We used Bronze Silver and Gold tables in Microsoft Fabric to transform and organise data. We also used
                        SCD2 to manage the data and make sure we were only reporting on the latest data. We used PySpark and PySql Notebooks to 
                        do this. 
                        <br><br>
                        Finally, we reported our findings using a PowerBI dashboard. We used the data from the Gold table to create the dashboard.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Final Thoughts</strong><br>
                        This project was a great learning experience as it was one of the first times that I've been available
                        to take different skills that I've worked on over the years (Python, Data Engineering and PowerBI) and 
                        apply it in the same real world project. I was able to see the full lifecycle of a data project from start to finish.
                        <br><br>
                        Some setbacks we had were having to learn how to use Selenium and Chromium, and learning the complexities of webscraping.
                        In particular, stopping popups. I noticed that the same pop-up showed up every time you opened the website 
                        we were scraping, so we could easily implement code to close the pop-up if it showed. However, we know that as soon as the website
                        gets changed, our webscraper won't work. API's are much better for this. Another setback we had was issues with Fabric compute and running
                        external scripts through Fabric. This project was done very early 2024 when Fabric had just been released, so we were trying to break it as well
                        as use it for the project. It was a good tool to use, and it was cool how it integrated all the Microsoft Data tools. I would like to learn more about it.
                        <br><br>
                        This was a very fun project, and I look forward to seeing how Fabric will be used in the future. 
                    </p>
