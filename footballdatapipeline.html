                    <p>This was an individual assignment to understand how a data pipeline works and how to use different technologies</p>
                    <p><br><strong>The project was composed of 4 stages:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Project Definition</li>
                            <li>Solution Software/Tools</li>
                            <li>Data Gathering</li>
                            <li>Pipeline Design and Implementation</li>
                        </ul><br>
                    <p>This was a personal project to get practical experience developing and implementing a data pipeline.
                        I decided to do football data because in my spare time I enjoy watching and playing football. The goal of this project 
                        was to understand how data pipelines work and what technologies were used to create them.
                        <br><br>
                        I used manual extraction to CSV, put them in to Azure Data Lake. I then used FiveTran as a data pipeline using Snowflake as the landing 
                        zone. I then used PowerBI to report on the data. It was interesting to use all these different tools. It's very different to software development
                        where you only have to use minimal frameworks and software, whereas here we used multiple to do a small task.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Final Thoughts</strong><br>
                        This was an interesting project to see the difference between the Software Engineering side of Computer Science and the Data Engineering/Science side 
                        of Computer Science. It was good to open my eyes to the opportunities in the future and was a very good experience to have 
                        before my internship.
                        <br><br>
                        I didn't have any setbacks as I had my Dad to help me out through the project. He has experience in Data as a Consultant 
                        which was a great help. I was able to get through the project with no issues.
                        <br><br>
                        Can't wait to do more of this in the future, it was very cool to see how the data migrated from one 
                        place to another because of the technologies I put in place.
