                    <p>This was a personal project. I was interested in automatic content creation, which I will go into further later.</p>
                    <p><br><strong>The project was composed of 3 stages:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Research into the project</li>
                            <li>Get Reddit API Key and learn how to use it</li>
                            <li>Develop script</li>
                        </ul><br>
                    <p>This was a personal project. I was interested in the new wave of "Automatic Content Creation". Specifically 
                        short form content of Reddit Story posts. The pipeline had already been developed of putting the story into 
                        an AI voice over generator. My issue was having to go to Reddit every time, get the Hot stories, copy and paste it into the voice AI,
                        but also make sure that I haven't already done that story. So I used created this Project
                        to automatically pull the stories from Reddit into a CSV file.
                        <br><br>
                        I created the project using Python, the Reddit API and Excel. This was my first time using an API so it was a good learning experience. I was able to get the API key and learn how to use it, getting 
                        50 Reddit stories every time. Every time I wanted to create some content, I just ran the script and was easily able to make some content.
                        <br><br>
                        The project was a success, but unfortunately there isn't a content creator payment scheme in NZ so it was a waste of time :( 
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Final Thoughts</strong><br>
                        This was a fun project to create and learn from. Then script was pretty easy to make, but unfortunately there wasn't any reason for 
                        me to keep using it. I'm glad I was able to learn how to use the API.
                        <br><br>
                        I didn't have many setbacks in this project, it was more just a learning process about using API's.
                        <br><br>
                        Fun Project. Hopefully I'll be able to use API's for a bigger project in the future.
